      So finally, you are here. That means you must have gone though that pain of preparing for GMAT test is a very hectic task, using stop watch before starting each question and stopping it when you answer, calculating overall time it took to finish a question or the whole test. Secondly choosing the next question, as it depends upon how you performed in previous one, which is only possible when you look at the correct answer of the question, which also consumes some time. Also it affects your mental level when you know you have correctly or incorrectly answered a question, which would not be the case when you are attempting actual GMAT exam. Thirdly analysing your overall performance after attempting a complete test will also be a pain in ass.
